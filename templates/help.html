    <h3>Overtime calculation</h3>
    <p>
        The overtime is calculated with following formula:
        <mark>overtime = worked time + excused time - daily maximum.</mark>
        Let's break this down:
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Worked time</u> is the sum of the attendances in a single day with all "Action" fields being empty.
        Please provide a clean timesheet where the order of sign-ins and sign-outs is correct, otherwise calculation may fail or provide incorrect numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Note</i>: Attendances with "Action" being "Outside office hours" are multiplied with <i>1.5</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Excused time</u> is the sum of the time when you are considered absent with approval.
        Currently, excusable absences are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sick / Medical consultation</li>
        <li>Authorities</li>
        <li>Requested Public Service</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <i>Note</i>: The excused time is capped at the daily maximum since this time is a "Goodie" from VSHN that you can use to avoid making undertime.
        For example, if your daily maximum is 8h (working schedule 100%), you have worked 8h, but also you log 1h of sick leave (total logged time 9h), then the sick leave is ignored and your overtime is 0 minutes.
        However, if you have worked 7.5h and recorded 1h sick leave (total logged time 8.5h), then your overtime is also 0 minutes as the sick leave is effectively worth 30m in this case.
        Conversely, if you are sick the whole day, be sure to log at least 8h (or your equivalent of your schedule) of sick leave for the day.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Daily maximum</u> is the calculated time that you have to work in a single day based on your working schedule in your contract.
        For example, for a 100% contract this is equal to 8h, for an 80% contract it's 6h24m, for a 60% contract it's 4h48m etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Note</i>: Before the introduction of the 40h-week in January 2021, the base daily max was 8h30m.
        The calculator should reflect this correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
        <i>Note</i>: All leaves (except "Unpaid") and days on weekends reduce the daily maximum by the contract-adjusted time.
        For example, a public holiday for an 80% working schedule equals to 6h24m.
    </p>
